HOW TO RUN :

NOTE: I have used my custom REACT-REDUX-SASS-WEBPACK Boilerplate to kick off with this assignment
but haven't used any redux architecture concept because of less time and also less complexity of 
the application.Hence the file structure of the project also includes Redux architecture and 
some not relevant dependencies. You may please ignore!!

clone/download the repo from github

access the file location and type "sudo npm install" in terminal CLI

after successful installation run > npm start in the terminal CLI

goto your browser(chrome) and access "http://localhost:8080/"... 
8080 is my default port for localhost..might vary for any concerned user
